# Digital-Forensics-Practical
This is a documentation which outlines the hands-on digital forensics skills I have gained through structured self-learning and practical exercises.

## Digital Forensics Fundamentals
### Description:
- I gained understanding of core digital forensics principles and best practices including evidence handling, evidence preservation, admissiblity of evidence and so on.

## Virtual Hard Disk Management
### Tools: Windows Disk Management
### What I did:
- I created, attached and detached Virtual Hard Disks to my local machine.
- I used VHDs to safely simulate forensic analysis environments without altering original data
### Why it matters:
- Used for evidence acquisition
- Enables forensic analysis in controlled environments
- Prevents contamination of original evidence

## File Integrity Verification (Hashing)
### Tools: HashMyFiles
### What I did:
- Calculated hash values of files and vhds to verify integrity
- Used hashes to confirm that files remained unchanged during acquisition and handling
### Why it matters:
- Ensures evidence authenticity
- Provides proof for legal admissibility and chain of custody

## Sanitization of Target Media
### Tools: Hardwipe, Cygwin tool.
### What I did:
- Properly wiped storage drives before use for forensic evidence acquisition
- Ensured clean media to avoid cross-contamination of evidence
### Why it matters:
- Prevents data contamination
- It is in line with forensic best practices

## Memory Acquisition
### Tools: Belkasoft RAM Capturer, Magnet Forensics and Dumpit
### What I did:
- Acquired live memory dumps from systems
- I understood the importance and neccessity of memory dump acquisition during digital forensics investigation.
### Why it matters:
- It helps to capture volatile data such as running processes, network connections etc. which would help foreniscs investigation.

## Disk Imaging & Disk Image Mounting
### Tools: Fex Imager, Arsenal Image Mounter, OSFMount.
### What I did:
- Acquired forensic disk images
- Mounted image files as drives for analysis without altering original evidence
### Why it matters:
- Allows safe analysis of suspect systems
-Helps to view the drive from the suspect's perspective.
- Maintains forensic integrity

## Key Takeaways
- I developed practical hands-on digital forensics skills
- I learnt the digital forensics best practices.
- I gained confidence working with real forensic tools and workflows
